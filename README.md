# GitClock LifeCycle

gitClock is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to help developers maintain a record of their contributions within a repository, even when they are not committing directly to the main branch. This extension tracks changes to files across all branches and provides a comprehensive list of file modifications, ensuring that every contribution is documented. Note: The change log only includes file names and does not contain any private data or commit details, respecting user privacy.
